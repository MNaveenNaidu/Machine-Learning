# KNNClassifier

This Repositiry consist of a KNN algoritm for a classification problem.
The Challenge is always how to get best 'K' nearest neighbors. To achive it, i have used the following techniques:-
1. Grid Search
2. Elbow Plot.
3. Loop through different values of 'K' and model them to get the accuracy(Consumes time.)

Through my analysis i found that 'Grid search' performs well and gives more accurate results as compared to Elbow plot.
